# Astro Bot (PPSA21564) on Windows

This branch is [oneandonlydean/AnyPS5 `astrobot`](https://github.com/oneandonlydean/AnyPS5/tree/astrobot) (Linux) plus the Windows fixes it needs to run there. Without them the title crashes about 17 seconds after start on Windows.

| Commit | Upstream PR |
| --- | --- |
| fix(libSceAgcDriver): prefer a discrete GPU over the first suitable device | #282 |
| fix(libSceFiber): switch Windows stack bounds together with rsp | #283 |
| fix(libSceFiber): keep fiber stacks in shared guest memory writable on Windows | #283 |
| fix(libSceAgcDriver): destroy host imports of a replaced Vulkan device | #284 |

Tested on Windows 11, MinGW-w64 GCC 15.2.0, RTX 5070 Ti: boot, PlayStation Studios video, Team Asobi logo and the title screen render, with no GPU hang and no loop guard. Run with `APS5_HOST_IMPORT_MIB=20480`.

# AnyPS5: Astro Bot (PPSA21564) fork

This fork's `main` mirrors `astrobot`, my integration branch for running Astro Bot (PPSA21564) on Linux with AnyPS5: upstream `main` plus fixes that are still on their way upstream or specific to this setup. Pull requests to upstream are always cut from upstream `main`.

## Astro Bot status

| Part | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot, PlayStation Studios video, logos | Renders |
| Title screen | Renders; copyright line missing (needs the PS5 system fonts) |
| NEW GAME menu | Renders |
| Intro cinematic | Renders; some minor fixes still to make (it takes about 20 minutes at the current frame rate) |
| Tutorial (Crash Site) | Playable with a DualSense; tutorial videos render |
| World map, controller ship flight | Reached |
| Performance | Low: about 15 to 30 fps in the menus, 4 to 11 fps in the cinematic and gameplay |

Known issues: the copyright line, some artifacts and minor glitches in the cinematic and gameplay, and the frame rate.

# About

Tool for automatic executables porting to Linux and Windows.

Includes a [relinker](core/relinker) that converts executable to the target system's native format and implementations of [system prx libraries](core/libs/prx) suitable for dynamic linking. No emulation or separate runtime process.

[Usage](docs/user/USAGE.md), [Build instructions](docs/dev/BUILD.md), [Technical debt of the project](docs/dev/TechnicalDebt.md), [code style conventions](docs/dev/CONVENTIONS.md), [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

[List of verified games](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md)

Dreaming Sarah (2D platformer) runs at a stable 60 fps on a GTX 1050 Ti / i5-7500 3.4GHz.

Unsupported or unexpected states strictly throw `std::runtime_error`. `what()` is printed to stderr and the process terminates.

The [shader recompiler](core/shader/recompiler/Recompiler.cpp) successfully produces SPIR-V (validated via [Spirv-Tools](3rdparty/SPIRV-Tools) when built with `ANYPS5_ENABLE_SPIRV_TOOLS`).

## Compatibility

See the [game compatibility list](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested games and known issues.

## Input mapping

SDL-mapped game controllers are supported, including analog sticks and triggers. Keyboard and mouse controls can be configured with an `anyps5-input.ini` file. See [input mapping](docs/user/INPUT_MAPPING.md) for the supported devices and configuration format.

## System fonts

Games that open the console's system font sets need font files in an `anyps5-fonts` directory beside the generated game executable; set `ANYPS5_SYSTEM_FONTS` to use another directory. Files dumped from the console are used under their own names (`SST-Roman.otf`, `SST-Bold.otf`, `SSTJpPro-Regular.otf`, ...). Without them, these openly licensed substitutes are used when present: `NotoSans-{Light,Regular,Medium,Bold}.ttf` and `NotoSans-{LightItalic,Italic,MediumItalic,BoldItalic}.ttf` (Latin and Vietnamese), `NotoSansMono-{Light,Regular,Medium,Bold}.ttf` (typewriter), `NotoSansThai-{Light,Regular,Medium,Bold}.ttf` (Thai) and `NotoSansCJK-{Light,Regular,Medium,Bold}.ttc` (Japanese and Chinese). Without either, opening a system font set fails and the game shows no text in those fonts.
